`nanoranger.py`:

- It imports necessary libraries and modules.
- Defines a class called `NanoRanger` that inherits from `tkinter.Frame`. This class represents the GUI and functionality of the NanoRanger device.
- Initializes the NanoRanger class with some attributes and user interface elements.
- Defines methods in the NanoRanger class for handling serial port communication, opening the port, reading data, saving data, updating GUI elements, and closing the port.
- Defines another class called `App` as the main application.
- Initializes an instance of the `App` class, which creates a GUI window using `tkinter` and sets up the NanoRanger object.
- Defines methods in the `App` class for starting and stopping real-time data visualization using `matplotlib`.
- If the script is executed directly (not imported as a module), it creates an instance of the `App` class to start the application.
